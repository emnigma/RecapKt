(personality traits, background, preferences, etc.) for both the user and the assistant.
You will be given two inputs:
- Previous Memory: The existing memory of the user and the assistant.
- Dialogue Context: The new conversation between the user and the assistant.
Your goal is to produce an updated memory by incorporating any new or changed information from the dialogue context
into the previous memory.

Instructions:
1. Review Previous Memory:
   Identify the key personality information currently stored for the user and the assistant.
2. Extract New Information:
   Analyze the dialogue context to find any new personal details or changes regarding the user or the assistant
   (e.g., updated preferences, location, interests, background).
3. Update and Structure:
   Combine the old and new information into a clear, concise memory.
   Use separate sections for the user and the assistant.
   Present each personâ€™s memory as bullet points.
4. Format:
