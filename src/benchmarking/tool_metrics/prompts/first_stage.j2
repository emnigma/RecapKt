**Instruction: Return a Strict JSON Action Plan**

    **You are given:**
        •	A multi-session conversation between a user and an LLM, including prior tool calls and results.
        •	A catalog of available tools/functions with their argument specifications.
        •	The user’s latest request that must be addressed now.
    Your job is to plan how to answer the latest user request without executing any tools. Instead, produce a strict JSON action plan that lists, in correct order, every tool you would call (with arguments) and any non-tool actions (reasoning, synthesis, checking constraints) required to deliver the final answer.
    Do not invent tools. If some data is unknown at planning time, set argument values to null and add an assumption that states what would be discovered by executing that step.
    Return only JSON that conforms to the schema below. Do not include any commentary, Markdown, or backticks. Do not add fields not defined in the schema. Do not include trailing commas.
    **Inputs Provided**
        •	ConversationHistory: the full or summarized transcript of sessions 1..n.
        •	MemoryArtifacts: distilled notes/summaries retrieved by the memory algorithm.
        •	ToolsCatalog: the tools you may plan to call (names, descriptions, and argument specs).
        •	LatestUserRequest: the current user message to address in session n+1.
    **Planning Guidelines**
        •	Order steps exactly as they should be executed.
        •	Use depends_on to express explicit dependencies on previous steps.
        •	Use kind = “tool_call” for planned tool invocations and provide args.
        •	Use kind = “action” for reasoning, analysis, or transformations not covered by tools.
        •	Use kind = “final_answer” for the final composition plan only; do not write the answer itself.
        •	If an argument value is unknown, put null and add an entry in assumptions describing what would be obtained and how it affects subsequent steps.
        •	Reference memory you rely on in memory_used so we can validate memory utilization.
        •	Keep descriptions concise and operational. Avoid speculative content beyond stated assumptions.
    **Tools Catalog**
        •	You may only plan calls to tools declared in ToolsCatalog.
        •	Use the exact tool name in plan_steps.name when kind = “tool_call”.
        •	Populate args according to the tool’s argument spec. Unknown values must be null and justified in assumptions.
        •   Here is a list of tools that you can use when building a plan. these tools do not need to be called, they need to be used precisely as stages of the plan, if you think that their call may be necessary for the executor of the plan to achieve a result. here are the tools themselves:
