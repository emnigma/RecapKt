 conversation context and persona, without introducing false or misleading information.

 information that adds value to the conversation and addresses the user's needs effectively.

You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing two AI assistant responses. You will evaluate them across three
 specific criteria and determine which response is better for each criterion.
## Input Information:
- Current Context: {context}
- Current Memory: {memory}
- Response 1: {first_response}
- Response 2: {second_response}

## Evaluation Criteria:

### 1. Faithfulness
Evaluate how well each response adheres to the given memory and maintains consistency with the established character
 traits. Consider:
- Does the response align with the assistant's defined personality?
- Are there any contradictions with previously established traits or information?
- Does the response maintain character consistency throughout?

### 2. Informativeness
Assess the quality and usefulness of information provided in each response. Consider:
- How comprehensive and relevant is the information?
- Does the response adequately address the user's query?
- Is the information accurate and helpful?
- Does it provide appropriate depth without being excessive?

### 3. Coherency
Evaluate the logical flow and contextual appropriateness of each response. Consider:
- Does the response flow logically and make sense in context?
- Are there smooth transitions between ideas?
- Does it appropriately respond to the conversation context?
- Is the response well-structured and easy to follow?

## Evaluation Options:
For each criterion, choose one of the following:
- Response 1 is better: Response 1 clearly outperforms Response 2
- Response 2 is better: Response 2 clearly outperforms Response 1
- Draw: Both responses are equally good

## Instructions:
Evaluate each criterion independently and provide your assessment for all three dimensions. Focus on objective
 evaluation based on the specific criteria rather than general preferences.

SINGLE_EVALUATION_MEMORY_PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template(

You are a meticulous and impartial evaluator. Your task is to assess the quality of the `Generated Memory`
 by comparing it to the `Ideal Memory`.

Your evaluation must be based on the following three criteria. You will compare the `Generated Memory` with the
 `Ideal Memory` (the "gold standard") to determine how well it aligns with it.

## Input Information:
- Generated Memory: {generated_memory}
- Ideal Memory: {ideal_memory}

### **Evaluation Criteria**

**1. Faithfulness (Accuracy)**
* **Question:** How accurately does the `Generated Memory` reproduce the facts and details presented in the
 `Ideal Memory`?
* **Assessment:** It should not contain information that contradicts or is absent from the `Ideal Memory`.
 Every piece of information in the `Generated Memory` should directly correspond to what is present in the
  `Ideal Memory`.

**2. Informativeness (Completeness and Relevance)**
* **Question:** Does the `Generated Memory` cover all the important information present in the `Ideal Memory`?
* **Assessment:** Evaluate whether it includes the most important topics, preferences, and facts outlined in the
 `Ideal Memory`. Does it omit critical details that are present in the `Ideal Memory`, or does it include trivial
  or irrelevant information?

**3. Coherency (Structure and Clarity)**
* **Question:** Is the `Generated Memory` well-organized, logical, and easy to understand?
* **Assessment:** The information should be structured in a clear and comprehensible way.
 Compare its structure and clarity to the `Ideal Memory`. Poor organization, confusing wording, or chaotic
  presentation should lower the score.

### **Score and Output Format**

Start your evaluation with a brief but thorough **Justification**. Justify your score by pointing out specific examples,
 strengths, or weaknesses in the `Generated Memory` compared to the `Ideal Memory`.

Then, assign an integer **Score** from 1 to 100 using the following scale:

* **81–100 (Very Good):** The `Generated Memory` is nearly identical to the `Ideal Memory` in terms of content,
 structure, and detail. It is accurate, comprehensive, and clear.
* **61–80 (Good):** The `Generated Memory` is mostly accurate and captures the main points, but may have minor omissions
 or slight structural issues compared to the `Ideal Memory`.
* **41–60 (Fair):** The `Generated Memory` reflects some key information but misses important details or contains minor
 inaccuracies compared to the `Ideal Memory`. Structure may be confusing.
* **21–40 (Poor):** The `Generated Memory` contains significant omissions, inaccuracies, or is poorly structured and
 difficult to understand.
* **1–20 (Very Poor):** The `Generated Memory` is largely inaccurate, includes contradictory information, or fails to
 convey the essence of the `Ideal Memory`.
